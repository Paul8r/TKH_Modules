Paul Rojas July 8,2021 H.W Assignment “What is a Network” The Knowledge House                        Module 1 Reading and Reflection:1) In your own word explain at his core what a computer is really doing whenever you type a letter on his keyboard?When the user types a letter on his keyboard, the letter type sends an input to the computer. The input is giving a signal to the CPU on what objective you want it to perform. As the computer is processing the input the given objective it will send an output to the monitor to display the result. 2) Explain in your own words what is a packet of data? A packet of data is a unit of data that travels along in a shared set of links. The share set of links is a network path that allows datagram forwarding. The datagram forwarding transmits the header through the various circuit. In this case, the transmitted data contains a destination address. The IP will transfer data that navigate data through the network towards the web or LAN. 3) Explain Data Rate, Throughput and Bandwidth? The data rate is the scale, which the binary digit(bit) transmits at a specific time in the network. Throughput determines the effectiveness of the data that is being goodput throughout the network. In conclusion, the Bandwidth determines the maximum amount of data rate of a given path. 4) Explain in your own words Datagram Forwarding?  Datagram forwarding deals with packet delivery when the packet that delivers the data across the network has a header.  The header will have a destination address to the various circuit.  The switches/routers to look into the forwarding table to determine the correct destination for the packet of data.5) Explain Algorithm in your own words?An algorithm is a procedure that solves mathematical problems.  When used in computation algorithm solves complex problems and processes their information into data. This data distributes through the network towards the LAN or web.  In cybersecurity, the algorithm is identified as cipher.6) Explain Network Topology? Network topology is when nodes and links distribute within the Content Distribution Network.  It's the network to communicate with each other. Network Topology can be physical or logical. The network distributes to LAN in 5 different topologies (Mesh, Star, Bus, Ring, Hybrid).
